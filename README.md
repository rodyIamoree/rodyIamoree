First of all, I have an obsession with making rentries, so expect tons of rentry remaking. I don't think my rentry will ever stay the same..

I'm ftm and primarly use it/its and they/them pronouns - aswell as any similar to these - please ask beforehand if you can use 'em on me! When it comes to he/him I'd prefer if you'd don't overuse them on me. she/her, any feminine terms are a big no.


I most likely 100% have GAD and possibly social anxiety which affects the way I interact with people. I usually never approach first and when I do I'd appreciate if you treat me with kindness. I'm almost always awkward at the start of any friendships however I will warm up eventually if I feel safe with you.
